# Begin playing snake game 
to begin the snake game:

    use ArrowUp         ^   for                    up control;
    
    use ArrowLeft       <   for                    left control; 
    
    use ArrowRight      >   for                    right control;
    
    use ArrowDown  (you can guess it !) for        down control;

have a fun!
